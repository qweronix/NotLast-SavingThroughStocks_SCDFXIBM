Detailed Solution:
The event we have identified is financial crises. We find this especially relevant as the COVID-19 situation has shown how unpredictable such events can be. With the use of stock market tracking, we can predict when an economic downturn might occur. This helps our issue of suicide, as suicide rates trend upward during and after financial crises. Having identified this, we want to help lessen the rate of suicides during these periods. What the SCDF can do with this model is to allocate resources more efficiently during these periods of time. Resources can be drawn away from less demanding sectors such as firefighting and put into more pressing ones such as EMS services. Manpower allocation can also be better handled if financial crises can be predicted; even knowing a week or two in advance can help to save the lives of many more people.
